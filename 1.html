<h2>JIMIN SPACE에 대한 설명</h2>
This is jiminnning's first <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/"
target = "blank" title = "web page specification"> web page</a> where I can write 
<strong>my <u>ideas</u> and thoughts</strong> that I want to shape up and realize someday.

<p>Even though I am now learning very basic grammar of html, I am going to learn
a lot more things that can creat innovative service. My eventual goal is to
make a world better place, and attribute my ability to that work. </p>
